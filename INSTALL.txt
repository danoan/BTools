In order to build BTools, you are going to need cmake.

cd [BTOOLS_ROOT_FOLDER]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install

There are plenty of configuration parameters, but usually, if all dependencies are installed in their standard
locations, that should be enough. Otherwise, if errors occur, it is likely that a manual configuration should be
done. In this scenario, ccmake is quite handy.
