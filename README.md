## BTools

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/50a49f3955c245e9977c282d2036e4a2)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/danoan/BTools?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=danoan/BTools&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

 BTools is a collection of applications developped for the 
 publication [1]. In this work, we describe a flow driven by 
 the minimization of the digital version of the elastica 
 energy. Its main applications are the **shape-flow**, 
 **boundary-correction** and ***interactive-seg** apps. The 
 latter integrates all the necessary steps to execute
 a segmentation using the proposed digital flow.

## Dependencies 

[libboost1.66.0-dev](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_66_0.html)

[opencv-3.3.0](https://opencv.org/releases.html)

[eigen-3.36](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

[DGtal0.9](https://dgtal.org/download/)

## Build and Install

In order to build BTools, you are going to need cmake.

```
cd [BTOOLS_ROOT_FOLDER]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install
```

There are plenty of configuration parameters, but usually, if 
all dependencies are installed in their standard
locations, that should be enough. Otherwise, if errors occur, 
it is likely that a manual configuration should be
done. In this scenario, ccmake is quite handy.

## How to use

Build instructions can be found in INSTALL.txt

This source contains five applications. For detailed description,
type: [application] -?

### seed-selector

Tool to select foreground, background and probably foreground masks.
The program outputs three pgm images, one for each mask, in the
output folder. These masks are used as input for the grab-cut 
algorithm.
 
### grab-cut

Executes grab-cut algorithm and creates a grab-cut object file.
 

### boundary-correction-app

Runs the boundary-correction algorithm. Given a grab-cut object file,
the digital curvature flow is evolved in order to enhance segmentation
quality with respect to curvature.

### shape-flow

Evolve the digital curvature flow along digital shapes.


### summary-flow

Overlay flow images in one single image.
